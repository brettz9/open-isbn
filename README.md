# open-isbn

A webextensions
([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-isbn/))
add-on which lets one highlight text or a link containing an
[ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number)
and visit the ISBN at [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/).

The context menu options only appear when right-clicking qualifying ISBN
links or selections, so it otherwise should not clutter the context menu.

Comes with two options, one to open in the same tab and another to open
in a different tab. Either can be disabled (thus also avoiding a submenu).

## To-dos

1. Allow specifying one's own URLs with substitute patterns (and with
    custom site title for context menu item label)
